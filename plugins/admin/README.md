# @leancodepl/contractsgenerator-typescript-plugin-admin

Plugin for generating api components schema from `AdminQuery` queries. This schema object is exported with
`export default` so this plugin should not be used together with other plugins with default exported components.

## Config

- `input` - same as `input` in the [project README](../../README.md#common-options)
